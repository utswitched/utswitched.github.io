                Now, let’s start talking about what we have in terms of the current build of the game!
            </p><br>
            <hr style="max-width:80%; border-color:gray">
            <h1>DEVELOPMENT</h1>
            <p>
                For the past few months, we mostly focused on the Introduction. It is taking quite a while because we
                have a different spin on the usual introduction sequence, but it’s 90% done!
            </p>
            <p>
                Although we can’t show said spin yet, we would like to showcase the work our team has made for it!
            </p>

            <h2>- MUSIC -</h2>
            <p>
                For this part of the game, we only really needed one piece of music; a rendition of Once Upon A Time. So
                we gave Chiiz, one of our composers, the task to make it, and here's what they came up with:
            </p>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="media/uts_intro.mp3">[If you're seeing this, your browser can't play audio.]
            </audio><br>
            <p>This is a draft of the introduction music, made by Chiiz.
                Even though the original Once Upon A Time sounded chiptune-y already, they <span class="addon">(in my
                    opinion)</span> made it even MORE like something you'd hear on an NES.
                Since it's a draft though, this version will not be in the actual game.
            </p>

            <h2>- ART -</h2>
            <p>
                For the Art in the Introduction, we asked Hawkow to draw sketches of what it should look like, and they
                gave us this:
            </p>
            <div class="hawkow-sketch">
                <div><img src="media/1-1.png"></div>
                <div><img src="media/1-2.png"></div>
                <div><img src="media/1-3.png"></div>
                <div><img src="media/1-4.png"></div>
                <div><img src="media/1-5.png"></div>
            </div>
            <p>
                I <span class="addon">(sushiwt)</span> wanted to lean more into Nessi’s imagination, so when I gave
                Hawkow the concepts for them to derive on, the humans had Nessi’s hairstyle and the monsters had
                Mipsqueek’s look.
            </p>
            <p>…and that’s basically it for the introduction! <span class="addon">(that we want to show
                    off..at least..)</span></p>
            <h2>Now, onto the rest of
                the stuff we have finished!</h2>
            <h2>- SPRITES -</h2>
            <p>
                Nessi has a spritesheet that consists of around 350 sprites <span class="addon">(Give or take, to
                    account
                    for repeated sprites)</span>,
                created by Pikmin_Drawn <span class="addon">(Dee)</span>. What we will say is that Nessi has different
                sprites for different outfits
                and routes.</p>
            [INSERT NESSI SPRITESHEET]
            <p>No, you cannot get a view of the current spritesheet because that would be leaking our plans!
            </p>
            <p>
                We also have brand new, cuter Mipsqueek sprites created by Dee and gruntlos! Their eyes are now beadier
                than
                before… We decided that a change was necessary, because we felt that the previous sprites for Mipsqueek
                didn’t really
                reflect their look in our artworks for the game.
            </p>
            <img src="media/mipsqueekwalk.gif" style="max-width:100%;">

            <h2>- PROGRAMMING -</h2>
            <p>
                For the coding side of things, we finally got a Dialogue System + NPC Interaction System that
                works..most of the time...<span class="addon">(created by sushiwt)</span>! The
                system uses a Godot Engine
                plugin called Dialogue Manager to do things like interact and talk to people, move characters around,
                and
                use items from the inventory.
            </p>
            <video controls>
                <source src="media/npc.mp4">[If you see this, your browser does NOT support the video element.]
            </video>

            <p>
                Speaking of the inventory, we also have a functioning version of the ITEM Menu <span class="addon">(also
                    created by sushiwt)</span>!
                This system entirely relies on the dialogue system though…
            </p>
            <video controls>
                <source src="media/item.mp4" type="video/mp4">[If you see this, your browser does NOT support the video
                element.]
            </video>

            <h2>- CONCEPT ART -</h2>

            <p>
                Last but not least, we have the Battle UI.
                The last time we showed our Battle UI concept, it looked like this:
            </p>
            <img src="media/battle1.png" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>
                But now, it looks like THIS!!!
            </p>
            <img src="media/battle2.png" style="max-width:100%;">
            <p>
                To add to the Nintendo-ness of this UI, Dee crafted big and Nintendo-like buttons that each correlate to
                their respective Nintendo game <span class="addon">(FIGHT being Link’s sword from The Legend Of Zelda,
                    ITEM
                    being a bag of the
                    Mushroom from Super Mario*, and ACT being one of the reaction icons from Animal Crossing)</span>.
                The UI
                Layout
                <span class="addon">(created by sushiwt)</span> is also reorganized to loosely resemble the Battle UI of
                Pokémon, with UNDERTALE
                elements like the monster grid and the HP/LV bars kept intact.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="addon">*The mushroom sprite (not the bag) was actually created by Gazey, from the battle
                    icons that were made way
                    before Dee redesigned them to be bigger…</span>
            </p>
            <hr style="max-width:80%; border-color:gray">
            <h1>CONCLUSION</h1>
            <p>
                Thank you all so much for waiting on us to work on this game, we are trying our hardest to make a free
                product that both fits UNDERTALE’s canonical narrative while also being its own spin on Toby’s RPG
                “freedom of choice” system. We assure you all that unless we say otherwise, UNDERTALE <span
                    style="color:#00daff">SWIT</span><span style="color:#ff002a">CHED</span> will become a reality.
                Please stay tuned for any future updates and game builds, which you can do in our <a
                    href="https://utswitched.github.io">WEBSITE</a> and <a
                    href="https://discord.gg/SxhH8sPDgA">DISCORD</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, we also have to be wary of any legal troubles we as a fangame team may get into because we
                may be
                using things from UNDERTALE and DELTARUNE. We are by no means claiming to be an official prequel to
                UNDERTALE, in fact, we acknowledge that there may never have been a SWITCH SOUL HUMAN in Toby’s
                world(s), or
                what being one would actually be like canonically. UNDERTALE <span
                    style="color:#00daff">SWIT</span><span style="color:#ff002a">CHED</span> is a fan interpretation and
                will be so unless we are somehow given the blessing from above or something similar.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is <span style="color:#ff002a; font-weight:bold;">NO CANONICAL SWITCH SOUL HUMAN</span>. Nessi is
                OUR SWITCH SOUL HUMAN, but there are plenty of other fan
                interpretations as to what they could be. If you like Nessi and see them as the more appropriate SWITCH
                SOUL HUMAN, then by all means, you may see them as such, but please, PLEASE remember that they are not
                canonical despite our attempts to remain as close to UNDERTALE’s canon as we can. We are making this
                game for
                fellow fans, to give you all a product that you all can enjoy without even having to spend a penny! We
                love you
                all, and we hope that you can enjoy our UNDERTALE <span style="color:#00daff">SWIT</span><span
                    style="color:#ff002a">CHED</span> when we finally release it in full.
